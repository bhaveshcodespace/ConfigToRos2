step1: configure config.sh

step2: run ./create_ros2_workspace.sh

step3: run ./create_rclpy_pkg.sh






No need worry about:
    1.remember ros2 commands 
    2.create directory/src , also no need to worry about 
    3.source setup.bash etc.

Everything handeled by create_ros2_workspace.sh file
User just needs to define config.sh correctly 
Thank You..
